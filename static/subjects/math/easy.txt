According to the Archimedean Property, for any two positive real numbers x and y:| x<yx < yx<y implies xn<yx^n < yxn<y for all n∈N | There exists a natural number n such that x>yn  x > yn⋅x>y |  x is always greater than y when multiplied by a large nnn | x and y have no upper bound |b
A sequence an is said to be convergent if: | an is unbounded. |an has no limit. | an approaches a finite limit as n→∞n to n→∞. | an oscillates indefinitely. | c
If a sequence an is monotone and bounded,then: |It is necessarily divergent | It is necessarily convergent. | It must have negative values. | It does not have a limit. | b
The Cauchy Criterion for convergence of a sequence states that | Every sequence is Cauchy. | A sequence is Cauchy if and only if it is convergent. | A sequence is Cauchy if it has a subsequence. | A sequence is Cauchy if its terms are bounded. | b
